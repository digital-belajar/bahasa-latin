# SUBJECT & OBJECT
## Word Order
The words in a Latin sentence are not usually in the same order as they would be in an English sentence. For example, sum nauta and nauta sum mean the same thing. This may seem strange to you at first, but it will become easier with practice.

EXERCISES:
1. **Sum nauta.**
2. **Nauta sum**

## NEW WORD: **ego**

**Sum** means _I am_ by itself. However, **ego** may also be used with sum. Whether you say **sum** or **ego sum**, it still just means _I am._ **Ego** is often used for emphasis.

Remember: The words in a Latin sentence may be in an unusual order.

EXERCISES:
1. **Sum**.
2. **Ego sum**.
3. **Sum nauta**.
4. **Nauta sum**.
5. **Ego sum nauta**.
6. **Ego nauta sum**.
7. **Nauta ego sum**.

## NEW WORD: **agricola**
MEANING: _farmer_

EXERCISES:
1. **Sum agricola.**
2. **Agricola sum.**
3. **Ego sum agricola.**
4. **Ego agricola sum.**
5. **Sum nauta.**
6. **Nauta sum.**
7. **Ego nauta sum.**
8. **Nauta ego sum.**

## NEW WORD: **et**
MEANING: _and_

Most of the time, et simply means and. But, if you use it twice, it can mean both...and. Here is an example:
**Sum et nauta et agricola** (_I am both a sailor and a farmer_).

EXERCISES:
1. **Nauta et agricola**
2. **Agricola et nauta**
3. **Ego sum nauta.**
4. **Nauta sum.**
5. **Et agricola et nauta sum.**
6. **Ego sum et nauta et agricola.**

## NEW WORD: **nōn**
MEANING: _not_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: In both classical and ecclesiastical pronunciation, **nōn** rhymes with bone, loan and tone.

In a sentence, **nōn** usually comes immediately before the verb. For example, **nōn** sum means I am not.

EXERCISES:
1. **Nōn sum.**
2. **Ego nōn sum.**
3. **Nōn sum nauta.**
4. **Nauta nōn sum.**
5. **Ego agricola nōn sum.**
6. **Agricola ego nōn sum.**
7. **Sum et nauta et agricola.**
8. **Et agricola et nauta ego sum.**

## NEW WORD: **es**
MEANING: _you are_
In English, it takes two words to say _you are_. In Latin, it takes only one: es**.

**Es** is used only when speaking to one person.

EXERCISES:
1. **Es.**
2. **Nōn es.**
3. **Es agricola.**
4. **Agricola es.**
5. **Nōn es agricola.**
6. **Agricola nōn es.**
7. **Sum agricola.**
8. **Ego nōn sum nauta.**
9. **Es et nauta et agricola.**
10. **Nauta sum et agricola es.**

## NEW WORD: **est**
MEANING: _he is_

In English, it takes two words to say _he is_. In Latin, it takes only one: **est**. **Est**
can also mean _she is_ and _it is_, but for now just translate est as _he is_.
EXERCISES:
1. **Est poēta.**
2. **Poēta est.**
3. **Est nauta.**
4. **Nauta est.**
5. **Nōn est agricola.**
6. **Nōn es nauta.**
7. **Agricola nōn es.**
8. **Ego nōn sum.**
9. **Et agricola et poēta sum.**
10. **Ego nauta nōn sum.**

Let’s learn another way to use **est**. Sometimes **est** simply means is. Consider the following example:

**Poēta est agricola.**

This sentence means the _poet_ is a _farmer_. Here, it is clear that **poēta** is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out _he_ and **est** simply means _is_.

In other cases, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

**Poēta est.**

This sentence means _he is a poet_. Here it is clear that there is no other word available to be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate est as _he is_. 

If you cannot figure out whether **est** means _is_ or _he is_, try them both. The correct meaning of est should become clear.

EXERCISES:
1. **Agricola est poēta.**
2. **Nauta est poēta.**
3. **Est nauta.**
4. **Poēta nōn est nauta.**
5. **Nauta nōn est.**
6. **Poēta est agricola.**
7. **Nauta nōn est agricola.**

## NEW WORD: **sumus**
MEANING: _we are_

When studying any language it is important to notice whether each individual word is singular or plural. Why? Because each word in a sentence must interact correctly with the words around it. In grammatical terms, this is
called agreement. See if you can figure out what is wrong with the following example:

**Sum agricolae.**

Did you notice something strange about that sentence? This sentence does not make any sense because it means I am farmers. In other words, **sum** and **agricolae** do not agree because **sum** is singular and **agricolae** is plural. A correct sentence would be **sum agricola** because **sum** and **agricola** agree. Again, see if you can figure out what is wrong with the following example:

**Sumus agricola.**

This sentence does not make any sense either because it means _we are a farmer_. **Sumus** and **agricola** do not agree because **sumus** is plural and **agricola** is singular. A correct sentence would be **sumus agricolae** because **sumus** and **agricolae** agree.

EXERCISES:
1. **Sumus.**
2. **Sumus nautae.**
3. **Nautae sumus.**
4. **Agricolae nōn sumus.**
5. **Nōn sumus agricolae.**
6. **Sumus agricolae et poētae.**
7. **Poēta nōn es.**
8. **Ego sum poēta.**
9. **Poēta est nauta.**
10. **Nauta est.**

## NEW WORD: **sunt**
MEANING: _they are_

**Sunt** is very similar to **est**. **Sunt** can mean _they are_ or just _are_. Consider the
following example:

**Agricolae sunt poētae.**

This sentence means the _farmers are poets_. Here it is clear that **agricolae** is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out they and **sunt** simply means _are_.

In other cases, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

**Poētae sunt.**

This sentence means _they are_ poets. Here there is no other word available to be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate sunt as they are.

Again (just as with **est**), if you cannot figure out whether **sunt** means _are_ or
_they are_, try them both. The correct meaning of **sunt** should become clear.

EXERCISES:
1. **Poētae sunt.**
2. **Poētae sunt agricolae.**
3. **Agricolae nōn sunt.**
4. **Poētae sunt nautae.5. Poēta est.**
6. **Estis poētae.**
7. **Nautae nōn sunt agricolae.**
8. **Agricola est poēta.**
9. **Nautae sumus.**
10. **Nōn es poēta**

## PERSON

We have already covered singular and plural. Now let’s talk about another quality that verbs have. In Latin, verbs tell not only what action is taking place, but also who is performing the action. Verbs can be in the first person, second person, or third person.

Verbs that refer to I or we are first person (the person who is speaking).

Verbs that refer to you, either singular or plural, are second person (the person or people to whom the speaker is speaking). In this book we will use y'all for the second person plural to help distinguish it from the second person singular.

Verbs that refer to he, she, it, or they are third person (the person, thing, people, or things being spoken about).

The following chart should help illustrate this concept

| | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person|  _I_ | _we_ |
| 2nd person | _you_ | _you all/y'all_ |
| 3rd person | _he, she, it_ | _they_ |

If we put all the Latin verbs you know in a chart like the one above, it would look like this:

| | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person| **sum** | **sumus** |
| 2nd person | **es** |  **estis** |
| 3rd person | **est** | **sunt** |

Remember to chant or sing these verbs over and over in order to memorize them.

In the exercises below, determine what the subject of each sentence is. Then, determine if it is first person, second person, or third person. Finally, determine whether it is singular or plural.

EXERCISES:
1. **I am hungry.**
2. **You are a nice person.**
3. **She is very smart.**
4. **We are going to the park.**
5. **Y'all have a beautiful home.**
6. **They eat lunch at Aunt Martha’s house every Sunday.**
7. **He is a tennis player.**
8. **It is a history book.**
9. **Y'all really know how to throw a party.**
10. **The flowers in your garden are pretty.**

## DIRECT OBJECTS
When **nauta** is the subject of a sentence it appears in its normal form which is **nauta**. When **nauta** is the direct object in a sentence, we change the ending to **-am**. That makes it **nautam** instead of nauta. Use **nautam** only with action verbs, not verbs of being or existing like _am_, _are_, or _is_ (also called
linking verbs). A word that renames the subject of the sentence after a linking verb is called a predicate nominative. Predicate nominatives take the normal form of the word, not the direct object form. Here are some examples to help illustrate these concepts:

_The **nauta** saw an island._

In this sentence, sailor is the subject of the sentence, so it retains its normal form which is nauta. Here is another example:

_I saw a **nautam**._

In this sentence, sailor is the direct object, so the ending changes to **-am** to make **nautam**. Here is a third example:

_The man is a **nauta**._

In this sentence, sailor is the predicate nominative (a word that renames the subject of the sentence after a linking verb) so it retains its normal form which is **nauta**.

In the exercises below, fill in the blank with either **nauta** or **nautam**. Then, give the reason for your choice. Choose from among the following three reasons:

** Because it is the subject of the sentence
** Because it is the direct object of the sentence
** Because it is a predicate nominative

Write your answers in your notebook or on a separate sheet of paper.

EXERCISES:
1. Yesterday, I saw a ________ down at the dock.
2. I am a ________.
3. A ________ steered the ship into the harbor.
4. I hired a ________ to help us steer the boat.
5. A ________ walked toward the ship.
6. The ________ is very strong.
7. I watched the ________ as he lowered the anchor.
8. He is a ________.
9. You helped the ________ with the rope.
10. I will be a ________ someday

# VERB
## NEW WORD: **spectō**
MEANING: _I watch, I do watch, I am watching_

**Spectō** is our first action verb in Latin. It means _I watch, I do watch_, or _I am
watching_. You can use words such as **ego** and **nōn** along with **spectō**, just as you would with **sum**.

In the last lesson, we learned that if **nauta** is a direct object, the ending changes to **-am**. This rule is also true for **agricola** and **poēta**. **Agricola** becomes **agricolam** and **poēta** becomes **poētam**. Keep this in mind as you translate the exercises into English. Don’t let the order of the words confuse you. Instead, just focus on the function of each individual word.

Since **spectō** can mean _I watch, I do watch_, or _I am watching_, you must decide on your own which one sounds best when you translate the exercises into English.

EXERCISES:
1. **Spectō nautam.**
2. **Nautam spectō.**
3. **Nōn spectō agricolam.**
4. **Agricolam spectō.**
5. **Spectō poētam.**
6. **Poētam spectō.**
7. **Ego spectō et nautam et agricolam.**
8. **Nauta nōn sum.**
9. **Agricolae sunt.**
10. **Poētae nōn estis.**

## NEW WORD: **stella**
MEANING: _star_

Think of the possible endings of **stella** and how each one would be used in a sentence.

EXERCISES:
1. **Stellam spectō.**
2. **Stellās nōn spectō.**
3. **Stellam ego spectō.**
4. **Ego spectō stellās.**
5. **Nautae sunt.**
6. **Nōn estis agricolae.**
7. **Poētae sumus.**
8. **Spectō et agricolās et nautās.**
9. **Nauta nōn est poēta.**
10. **Agricola es.**

## NEW WORD: **lūna**
MEANING: _moon_

Think of the possible endings of lūna and how each one would be used in a sentence.

EXERCISES:
1. **Lūnam spectō.**
2. **Spectō stellās.**
3. **Et lūnam et stellās spectō.**
4. **Spectō et stellās et lūnam.**
5. **Lūna nōn est stella.**
6. **Poēta est et agricola sum.**
7. **Spectō nautās.**
8. **Nōn estis agricolae.**
9. **Sumus poētae.**
10. **Agricolae sunt poētae.**

## NEW WORD: **spectās**
MEANING: _you watch, you do watch, you are watching_

This chart should come in handy as we learn additional forms of **spectō**. 

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | spectō | |
| 2nd Person | **spectās** | |
| 3rd Person | | |

Remember: You must decide on your own whether to translate **spectās** as _you watch, you do watch_, or _you are watching_.

EXERCISES:
1. **Spectās lūnam.**
2. **Spectās stellās.**
3. **Et lūnam et stellās spectās.**
4. **Et nautās et agricolās spectās.**
5. **Ego spectō et nautās et agricolās.**
6. **Stellās ego nōn spectō.**
7. **Poētae nōn sumus.**

## NEW WORD: **spectat**
MEANING: _he watches, he does watch, he is watching_

The chart is getting fuller:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | spectō | |
| 2nd Person | spectās | |
| 3rd Person | **spectat** | |

Do you remember the different ways to use est? Spectat is like that, too.
Let’s look at an example:

**Nauta stellās spectat.**

This sentence means _the sailor is watching the stars_. Here, it is clear that **nauta** is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out he and **spectat** simply means _is watching_.

Other times, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

**Stellās spectat.**

This sentence means _he is watching_ the stars. Here, there is no other word available to be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate **spectat** as _he is watching_.

Of course, spectat could also mean _she is watching_ or _it is watching_. But for now, just translate spectat as _he is watching_.

EXERCISES:
1. **Spectat lūnam.**
2. **Nauta stellās spectat.**
3. **Spectat stellās et lūnam.**
4. **Agricola stellās nōn spectat.**
5. **Agricola nautam spectat.**
6. **Lūnam spectās.**
7. **Et poētam et agricolam spectō.**
8. **Agricolae nōn estis.**
9. **Agricola est.**
10. **Nautae sunt poētae**

## NEW WORD: **spectāmus**
MEANING: _we watch, we do watch, we are watching_

We’re over halfway there!

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | spectō | **spectāmus** |
| 2nd Person | spectās | |
| 3rd Person | spectat | |

EXERCISES:
1. **Spectāmus agricolās.**
2. **Nōn spectāmus poētam.**
3. **Stellās spectat.**
4. **Et lūnam et stellās spectās.**
5. **Nautae nōn sunt.**
6. **Ego nōn spectō lūnam.**
7. **Agricola es et nauta sum.**
8. **Poēta est agricola.**
9. **Nōn es nauta.**
10. **Poētae sumus.**

## NEW WORD: **spectātis**
MEANING: **y’all watch, y’all do watch, y’all are watching**

We’re almost there!

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | spectō | spectāmus |
| 2nd Person | spectās | **spectātis** |
| 3rd Person | spectat | |

EXERCISES:
1. **Spectātis stellam.**
2. **Agricolās spectātis.**
3. **Nautās spectātis.**
4. **Lūnam spectāmus.**
5. **Agricola poētam spectat.**
6. **Et lūnam et stellās spectās.**
7. **Nautās nōn spectat.**
8. **Sumus agricolae.**
9. **Nōn estis nautae.**
10. **Agricola est.**

## NEW WORD: **spectant**
MEANING: _they watch, they do watch, they are watching_

The chart is now full!

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | spectō | spectāmus |
| 2nd Person | spectās | spectātis |
| 3rd Person | spectat | **spectant** |

Do you remember the different ways to use **sunt**? **Spectant** is like that, too.

Let’s look at an example:

**Agricolae lūnam spectant.**

This sentence means _the farmers are watching the moon_. Here, it is clear that _agricolae_ is the subject of the sentence. Therefore, we leave out they and **spectant** simply means are watching.

Other times, there is no other word to be the subject of the sentence, as in the following example:

**Stellās spectant.**

This sentence means _they are watching the stars_. Here, there is no other wordto be the subject of the sentence. So, we translate spectant as _they are watching_.

EXERCISES:
1. **Poētās spectant.**
2. **Poētae stellās spectant.**
3. **Nautae et lūnam et stellās spectant.**
4. **Spectās agricolam.**
5. **Lūnam ego spectō.**
6. **Spectātis nautam.**
7. **Agricolae sunt.**
8. **Nōn sum nauta.**
9. **Agricola es.**
10. **Agricola est poēta.**

## REVIEW
We now know all six present tense forms of sum and spectō. Let’s review them now. Here is the chart for sum:

| | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st person|  **sum** | *sumus* |
| 2nd person | **es**  | *estis* |
| 3rd person | **est** | *sunt* |

Say all six forms in sequence: **sum**, **es**, **est**, **sumus**, **estis**, **sunt**. It is best to memorize them. Try to think of what each word means as you say it.

Here is the chart for **spectō**:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | **spectō** | **spectāmus** |
| 2nd Person | **spectās** | **spectātis** |
| 3rd Person | **spectat** | **spectant** |

Repeat after me! **Spectō, spectās, spectat, spectāmus, spectātis, spectant**. Again, think of what each word means as you say it. Soon these groups of verbs will become second nature.

By now, you may be noticing a pattern to the endings of the verbs. If we made a chart of just the endings of **spectō** it would look like this:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | **-o** | **-mus** |
| 2nd Person | **-s** | **-tis** |
| 3rd Person | **-t** | **-nt** |

As with the verbs themselves, it is best to memorize these endings so you can recognize them easily. Spell them out by letters: **-o, -s, -t, -mus, -tis, -nt**.

From now on, when you learn a verb, you will know how to use it in all six present tense forms. You’ve come a long way from Lesson One. Keep up the good work.

# ADVERB
## NEW WORD: **saepe**
MEANING: _often_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: The **ae** in **saepe** will sound different depending on which pronunciation style you adopt. In classical pronunciation, the **ae** in **saepe** sounds like the English word _eye_. In ecclesiastical pronunciation, it will sound like the _e_ in _bet_.

**Saepe** is your first Latin adverb. An adverb is a word that describes how the action is taking place. When you translate the exercises, try to put the adverb where it sounds the best.

EXERCISES:
1. **Stellās saepe spectō.**
2. **Stellās saepe spectant.**
3. **Poētam saepe spectās.**
4. **Poēta est.**
5. **Agricolae estis.**
6. **Poēta nōn est agricola.**
7. **Et lūnam et stellās saepe spectāmus.**
8. **Agricolae sunt poētae.**
9. **Sumus poētae.**
10. **Lūnam saepe nōn spectātis**

## NEW WORD: **numerō**
MEANING: _I count, I do count, I am counting_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: If you are using the ecclesiastical style of pronunciation, remember to roll the _r_ in **numerō** lightly. The endings for **numerō** are the same as for **spectō**. Review them as often as you need to with this handy chart:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st Person | **numero**  | **numeratmus** |
| 2nd Person | **numeras** | **numeratis** |
| 3rd Person | **numerat** | **numerant** |

EXERCISES:
1. **Stellās numerō.**
2. **Numerās stellās.**
3. **Nauta stellās numerat.**
4. **Stellās saepe numerāmus.**
5. **Nautās numerātis.**
6. **Nautae stellās saepe numerant.**
7. **Agricolae nōn sunt poētae.**
8. **Nautae sunt.**
9. **Sumus agricolae.**
10. **Poēta es**

## NEW WORD: **fēmina**
MEANING: _woman_

**Fēmina** is the first word we have encountered in this book that refers to someone of the female gender. Remember that **est** can be translated as _he is, she is_, or _it is_. Now, you will have an opportunity to translate sentences such as the following example:

**Fēmina est.**

This sentence means _she is a woman_. It should be clear when to use _he, she_ or _it_ in your translations.
When **est** does not refer directly to a female, continue to translate it as _he is_.

EXERCISES:
1. **Fēmina est.**
2. **Fēminae sumus.**
3. **Sum fēmina.**
4. **Fēmina pecūniam portat.**
5. **Pecūniam nōn portant.**
6. **Agricola est.**
7. **Ego pecūniam saepe nōn numerō.**
8. **Agricola es.**
9. **Nautae sunt poētae.**
10. **Lūnam spectāmus.**

## NEW WORD: **amō**
MEANING: _I love, I do love, I am loving, I like, I do like, I am liking_

You must decide on your own whether to translate **amō** as _I love_ or _I like_. How will you know which one to choose? Just use the one that sounds best in the context of the sentence.

Can you name the six forms of **amō** and tell what they mean?

EXERCISES:
1. **Fēminae agricolam nōn amant.**
2. **Puella nautam amat.**
3. **Poētam amāmus.**
4. **Et lūnam et stellās amō.**
5. **Puella aquam saepe portat.**
6. **Sum puella.**
7. **Pecūniam semper portātis.**
8. **Fēminae sumus et puellae sunt.**
9. **Nōn sum nauta.**
10. **Stellās numerāmus.**

## NEW WORD: **numquam**
MEANING: _never_

**Numquam** is another adverb just like **saepe** and **semper**.

EXERCISES:
1. **Aquam numquam portō.**
2. **Fēmina tabulās numquam portat.**
3. **Nautae scaphās semper spectant.**
4. **Ego pecūniam semper numerō.**
5. **Spectās numquam lūnam.**
6. **Stellās saepe spectātis.**
7. **Puella silvam amat.**
8. **Poētae estis.**
9. **Nautae sumus et scaphās amāmus.**
10. **Nōn sum nauta**

## NEW WORD: **sed**
MEANING: _but_

The word **sed** often divides a sentence into two parts. To make translation easier, translate the part that comes before **sed** first and then translate the part that comes after **sed**.

EXERCISES:
1. **Agricola sum sed scaphās amō.**
2. **Fēmina pecūniam portat sed puellae aquam portant.**
3. **Nauta sum sed scaphās nōn amō.**
4. **Agricola est poēta.**
5. **Agricola silvam nōn amat.**
6. **Scaphās spectant.**
7. **Puellae aquam numquam portant.**
8. **Nauta silvam amat.**
9. **Stellās numerāmus.**
10. **Agricola nōn es.**

## NEW WORD: **arō**
MEANING: _I plow, I do plow, I am plowing_

EXERCISES:
1. **Terram arō.**
2. **Agricolae terram arant.**
3. **Puella terram saepe arat.**
4. **Terram numquam arās.**
5. **Nautae scaphās amant.**
6. **Sumus agricolae sed scaphās amāmus.**
7. **Poēta nōn es sed tabulās saepe portās.**
8. **Agricolae estis sed terram numquam arātis.**
9. **Nautae sunt sed sumus poētae.**
10. **Poētae tabulās semper portant**

## NEW WORD: **ambulō**
MEANING: _I walk, I do walk, I am walking_

EXERCISES:
1. **Ambulāmus.**
2. **Fēmina ambulat.**
3. **Nautae pecūniam portant.**
4. **Terram saepe nōn arātis.**
5. **Nautae pecūniam saepe numerant.**
6. **Lūnam ego spectō sed stellās spectās.**
7. **Nauta es sed poēta sum.**
8. **Tabulās nōn portāmus.**
9. **Fēminae silvam amant.**
10. **Nautae sunt sed scaphās nōn amant.**

# PREPOSITION
## NEW WORD: **ad**
MEANING: _to, toward_

A preposition is a word that shows a physical relationship between two nouns. Examples of prepositions are _in, to, beside, with, behind, under_ and _over_. **Ad** is your first Latin preposition. **Ad** can mean to or _toward_. Use the meaning that makes the most sense in context.

When you use **ad**, the word it refers to must have the direct object ending. For instance, to the forest would be **ad silvam**, not **ad silva**. And in the plural, toward _the sailors_ would be **ad nautās**, not **ad nautae**.

EXERCISES:
1. **Ad silvam ambulō.**
2. **Nautae ad scaphās ambulant.**
3. **Ad silvam ambulās sed ad aquam ambulō.**
4. **Pecūniam ad scapham portāmus.**
5. **Scapham ad aquam portant.**
6. **Agricola terram semper arat.**
7. **Ad silvam numquam ambulās.**
8. **Terram amō sed nōn sum agricola.**
9. **Poētae sunt sed tabulās numquam portant.**
10. **Fēmina nōn sum**

# CASES
In Latin, the endings of nouns change according to what role or function they play in a given sentence. Any noun may have many different forms. These different forms of nouns are called cases. When we use a word as the subject of a sentence, that word is said to be in the nominative case. We also use the nominative case for predicate nominatives. When we use a word as a direct object, that word is said to be in the accusative case. We also use the accusative case with certain prepositions like **ad**. There are five cases in all.
Examine the chart below.

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Nominative (subject/predicate nominative) | **nauta** | **nautae** |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. Accusative (direct object/object of preposition) | **nautam** | **nautas** |
| 5. | | |

Each case performs certain functions while working together with the other cases to create meaningful sentences. As you can see from the chart, you already have experience with two of the five cases. As you learn the second, third, and fifth cases, you will be able to translate more complex (and interesting) exercises.

## NEW WORD: **circum**
MEANING: _around_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: In classical pronunciation, each _c_ in **circum** sounds like the _k_ in _kitchen_. In ecclesiastical pronunciation, the first _c_ will sound like the _ch_ in _cheese_, and the second one will sound like the _k_ in _kitchen_.

**Circum** is another preposition. Like **ad**, **circum** takes the accusative (direct object) case.

EXERCISES:
1. **Circum īnsulam nāvigō.**
2. **Circum silvam saepe ambulāmus.**
3. **Nautae circum īnsulam semper nāvigant.**
4. **Ad casam ambulāmus.**
5. **Nōn sum agricola sed terram saepe arō.**
6. **Nōn es poēta sed tabulās semper portās.**
7. **Et stellās et lūnam saepe spectās.**
8. **Nauta scaphās amat.**
9. **Nōn sumus agricolae sed terram amāmus.**
10. **Et actam et silvam amō.**

## NEW WORD: **prope**
MEANING _near_

**Prope** is another preposition. Like **ad** and **circum**, **prope** takes the accusative (direct object) case.

EXERCISES:
1. **Prope actam ambulant.**
2. **Casa nōn est prope silvam.**
3. **Prope īnsulās nāvigāmus.**
4. **Scaphae circum īnsulās numquam nāvigant.**
5. **Es prope silvam.**
6. **Scaphās semper ego spectō.**
7. **Fēminae et puellae prope silvam sunt.**
8. **Aquam portātis.**
9. **Prope īnsulam semper natāmus.**
10. **Nauta nōn est sed scaphās amat.**

# ABLATIVE CASE
The fifth case on our chart is called the ablative case. The ablative case can be used in many ways.

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Nominative (subject/predicate nominative) | nauta | nautae |
| 2. |  |  |
| 3. |  |  |
| 4. Accusative (direct object/object of preposition) | nautam | nautas |
| 5. Ablative (many uses) | **nauta** | |

The ablative singular is spelled the same as the nominative singular. The only visible difference is that the ablative singular has a mark over its final letter. This mark is called a macron. This macron will help you to distinguish the ablative singular from the nominative singular. In this book you will learn two different ways to use the ablative case.

## NEW WORD: **in**
MEANING _in, on_ (takes ablative case), _into_ (takes accusative case)

So far, all the prepositions you know (**ad, circum, prope**) take the accusative case. Not all prepositions, however, take the accusative case. Some prepositions take the ablative case. The new word for this lesson, **in**, takes either the accusative case or the ablative case depending on what it means. In can mean _in, on,_ or _into_. When **in** means _into_, it takes the accusative case.

When **in** means _in_ or _on_, it takes the ablative case. When you translate the exercises you will have to figure out whether to translate **in** as _in_ or _on_. To learn more about how the word **in** is used, examine the following examples:

**In casā sum.**

Because **in** takes the ablative case here, that narrows our choices down to either _in_ or _on_. Because of the context, the best translation for **in** is _in_. So, the sentence means _I am in the house_. Here is another example:

**In īnsulā sum.**

Because **in** takes the ablative case here, that again narrows our choices down to either _in_ or _on_. Because of the context, the best translation for **in** is _on_. So, the sentence means _I am on the island_. Here is another example:

**Agricola in casam ambulat.**

Because **in** takes the accusative case here (and because of the context of the sentence), we know that the best meaning for **in** is _into_. So, the sentence means _the farmer is walking into the house_.

EXERCISES:
1. **Sum in casā.**
2. **Nauta in īnsulā est.**
3. **Nautae in scaphā nōn sunt.**
4. **In īnsulā sumus.**
5. **Agricola circum casam ambulat.**
6. **Ad īnsulam saepe nāvigāmus.**
7. **Fēmina in casā est sed agricola in silvam ambulat.**
8. **Patriam dēsīderāmus.**
9. **Puella prope īnsulam natat.**
10. **Nōn es poēta sed tabulās portās.**

## ABLATIVE PLURAL
PRONUNCIATION TIP: In both classical and ecclesiastical pronunciation, the _i_ in **nautīs** sounds like the _ee_ in _meet_ and _sweet_.
The ablative plural has the ending **-īs**. Compare the ablative plural to the forms you already know in the chart below:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Nominative (subject/predicate nominative) | nauta | nautae |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. Accusative (direct object/object of preposition) | nautam | nautas |
| 5. Ablative (many uses) | nauta | **nautis** |

## NEW WORD: **schola**
MEANING _school_

Review the noun endings you know with this handy chart:

| | Singular | Plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Nominative (subject/predicate nominative) | **schola** | **scholae** |
| 2. | | |
| 3. | | |
| 4. Accusative (direct object/object of preposition) | **scholam** | **scholas** |
| 5. Ablative (many uses) | **schola** | **scholis** |

EXERCISES:
1. **Schola in silvā est.**
2. **Puellae ad scholam ambulant.**
3. **Puella est in scholā.**
4. **Puella tabulam ad scholam portat.**
5. **Nauta es sed scaphās nōn amās.**
6. **Nauta ego sum sed agricola es.**
7. **Ad īnsulās nāvigāmus sed patriam dēsīderāmus.**
8. **Agricolae sumus sed terram numquam arāmus.**
9. **Scapha in aquā est.**
10. **In scaphīs estis sed in aquā sum.**

## EVEN MORE ABOUT EST AND SUNT
Early in this book you learned two ways to use **est** and **sunt**. You learned that if a sentence already has a subject, **est** just means _is_. But, if a sentence has no other word to be the subject, **est** means he _is, she is,_ or _it is_.

Likewise, you learned that if a sentence already has a subject, **sunt** just means _are_. But, if a sentence has no other word to be the subject, **sunt** means _they are_.

Now I will show you another way that the words **est** and **sunt** are used in Latin. Est is used to mean there is and **sunt** is used to mean _there are_. Examine the following examples:

**Est fēmina in scaphā** _(there is a woman in the boat)._

**Sunt nautae in īnsulā** _(there are sailors on the island)._

Did you notice that in those examples **est** and **sunt** came first in the sentence? Keep this third possible use of **est** and **sunt** in mind as you do the exercises, especially when **est** or **sunt** is the first word of the sentence.

EXERCISES:
1. **Sunt puellae in casā.**
2. **Est scapha prope actam.**
3. **Prope īnsulam numquam natō.**
4. **Silvam dēsīderātis sed scaphās amāmus.**
5. **Īnsulās nōn amās.**
6. **Sunt et agricolae et fēminae in casīs.**
7. **Poēta terram et aquam amat.8. Fēminae in silvīs saepe ambulant.**
9. **Est pecūnia in scaphā.**
10. **Nōn sum agricola sed terram amō.**

## NEW WORD: **cotīdiē**
MEANING _daily_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: **Cotīdiē** has four syllables. In classical pronunciation it will sound like _ko-TEE-di-ay_. In ecclesiastical pronunciation, the _e_ at the end will sound like the _e_ in _bet_.

**Cotīdiē** is another adverb like **saepe**, **semper**, and **numquam**.

EXERCISES:
1. **Ad actam cotīdiē ambulāmus.**
2. **Nautae circum īnsulam cotīdiē nāvigant.**
3. **Agricola terram cotīdiē arat.**
4. **Puellae ad scholam cotīdiē ambulant.**
5. **Aquam ad casās cotīdiē portāmus.**
6. **Sunt nautae in īnsulīs.**
7. **Estis poētae sed agricolae sumus.**
8. **Lūnam spectātis sed stellās spectāmus.**
9. **Patriam dēsīderās sed īnsulās dēsīderō.**
10. **Poēta in casam ambulat.**

## NEW WORD: **ā, ab**
MEANING _from (takes the ablative case)_

PRONUNCIATION TIP: In both classical and ecclesiastical pronunciation, the _a_ in **ā** and **ab** sounds like the _o_ in _not_ and _pot_.

This preposition can be spelled either **ā** or *ab*. Generally speaking, **ā** is used if the next word starts with a consonant and **ab** is used if the next word starts with a vowel.

We have similar spelling variations in English, too. Consider the following examples:

A book

An apple

_A_ and _an_ are the same word but with one important difference. A comes before words that begin with a consonant and an comes before words that begin with a vowel. Why the variation in spelling? This is done in order to make pronunciation easier. For example, it is easier to say _a book_ than _an book_ and it is easier to say _an apple_ than _a apple_.

Likewise, **ab īnsulā** is easier to say than **ā īnsulā** and **ā patriā** is easier than
**ab patriā**. The concept is the same in Latin as it is in English.

EXERCISES:
1. **Puella ā casā ad scholam ambulat.**
2. **Scaphae ab īnsulā ad patriam cotīdiē nāvigant.**
3. **Fēmina pecūniam cotīdiē numerat.**
4. **Sunt agricolae in casā.**
5. **Ab īnsulā ad patriam nāvigāmus.**
6. **Nautae in īnsulā nōn sunt.**
7. **Ad actam cotīdiē ambulāmus.**
8. **Ego circum īnsulam nāvigō.**
9. **Estis agricolae sed terram numquam arātis.**
10. **Fēmina tabulās portat**

## NEW WORD: **cum**
MEANING _with (takes the ablative case)_

EXERCISES:
1. **Fēmina est in casā cum puellīs.**
2. **Agricola cum nautīs nōn est.**
3. **Ambulō ad actam cum nautīs.**
4. **Fēminae in scaphā cum nautīs sunt.**
5. **Puellae ā scholā ad actam cotīdiē ambulant.**
6. **Agricola est.**
7. **Nautae sunt in scaphīs et in īnsulā.**
8. **Terram amō sed agricola nōn sum.**
9. **Puellae in scholam cum tabulīs ambulant.**
10. **In scaphā sum sed in aquā es.**

## NEW WORD: **sine**
MEANING _without_ (takes the ablative case)

EXERCISES:
1. **Fēmina ad tabernam sine pecūniā numquam ambulat.**
2. **Nautae in īnsulā sine scaphā sunt.**
3. **Nauta es.**
4. **Puellae in īnsulā sunt sed ego in scaphā sum.**
5. **Nauta in īnsulā est sed patriam dēsīderat.**
6. **Poēta ad actam cotīdiē ambulat.**
7. **Agricola patriam amat.**
8. **Ā scholā ad actam ambulāmus.**
9. **Terram numquam arātis sed ego cotīdiē terram arō.**
10. **Fēmina in silvam cum puellīs ambulat.**


# POSSESSIVES
Possessive words show ownership of something. In English, we often show possession by using an apostrophe followed by an _s_. Consider the following examples:
* Fred’s car
* The nation’s flag
* Arizona’s capital

Sometimes we show possession by using the word _of_.
* The peak of the mountain
* The smell of garlic
* The beginning of the show

You must decide on your own whether to use an apostrophe or to use of to show possession.

Here are a few of the most basic rules to remember when using apostrophes:
| | Rule | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rule #1 | To make a noun that does not end in _s_ possessive, just add an apostrope and an _s_ | Lauren always wants to borrow Kate's book. |
| Rule #2 | To ake a singular noun that ends in _s_ possessive, add an apostrophe and an _s_ (just like rule #1) | The class's favourite subject was Latin. |
| Rule #3 | To make a plural noun that ends in _s_ possessive, add an apostrophe to end of the word. | Due to incresed interest in Latin, all the books' covers are starting to wear out. |
